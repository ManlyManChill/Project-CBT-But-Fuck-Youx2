DEVELOPMENT TIME HAS BEEN PARTIALLY STALLED!!!! Releases will be posted atleast once or twice every week since school is just around the corner, atleast for me and i have been told that its just 5 days left. PLEASE NOTE THAT I STILL ACCEPT CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE PROJECT WILL NOT BE DEAD IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE

discord server: [https://discord.gg/2RKNDK2S](https://discord.gg/DjDwktq8)

i am going insane, school starting so byee ill probably be less active on reddit or github.

i will move releases to weeekends and probably minor changes, unless i can get full time contributors then everyday releasing is now impossible

so regian made a video and did not post link
also if this leads to some shady drama i will probably pull the plug

before proceeding to download this modpack I'm not responsible for anything that can happen, by downloading this modpack you are atleast above the age of 15, common sense

groovyscript my beloved, more groovyscript pls, 

liquid concrete

![project-cbt-4](https://github.com/Nrmot-GithubRepo/Project-CBT/assets/141803157/3ebf1198-19a6-4d34-9522-0d828e803788)

## What is this and how do i get rid of it?

Project CBT: A minecraft modpack that tries to combine aspects of RLCraft, GTNH, Touhou and HBM's Nuclear Tech Mod into 1 totally not buggy masterpiece that will totally not destroy your c***

Also Sans from Undertale will make an appearance

## What is Project CBT:

Project CBT is the codename. The real name is Cock and Ball Touhouture: NuclearGreg Horizons

or you can just call it project cringe and bullshit torture if you don't want youtube demonization 

Will there be a curseforge upload: No but do it yourself. 

Yes there are releases and only dev releases exist for research purposes. 

For GregTech Progression, it will be standard GT progression until UV and UHV tier, in which case I am planning to implement 'releastic circuit crafting'

## How to Install Project CBT:

Get it from releases En Croissant Dummy

Once you, the En Croissant Dummy downloaded one of thoze Project-CBT dev zips just import to any launcher EGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.

## Getting Started

With the world at permanent nighttime with hardcore darkness you must find a glowing flower from Silent's Gems as it is the only natural light source spawning. If your surroundings doesn't have one, you are either fucked or you need to travel long way before finding a glowing flower, because why? Frick you I SLAPPED TFC, SCAPE AND RUN PARASITES, AND NOW ZOMBIE AWARENESS JUST TO DESTROY YOUR SANITY! RUN RUN RUN IF YOU SEE ANY OF THE HOSTILE MOBS, NO ONE NOT EVEN GREG CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE! What did you expect this is a modpack designed for pure c*ck and ball torture

## Lore

Summary: In the world of Cock and Ball Touhouture: NuclearGreg Horizons, where technology rules supreme., an unexpected portal opens, connecting the advanced industrial realm to the mystical land of Gensokyo. As the worlds collide, the characters from Gensokyo find themselves thrust into a spellbinding adventure, facing challenges they've never imagined. Together with the Touhou Project heroines, they must learn to harness the power of both science and magic to preserve the balance between the two worlds and overcome a common threat that could endanger them all.

Now you, the player are one of the characters stuck in this unfamilliar world.

So what do you do? WING IT. 

Gregification Imminent.

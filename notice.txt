Notice all players!

It has been apparent to the Ministry of CBT that you have been abusing the 
sound button to block all daily gregic programming instilled by the Ministry
of CBT! We have decided to ban the use of all sound sliders and you will
no longer be able to mute any sound in Project CBT! 

We have recieved reports from some higher ups in Project CBT dev team and
with the evidence we found, we at Ministry of CBT have decided to take
action and mandate the removal of all volume buttons.

If you have any complaints, then explode you acidic son of Mekanism.
- Kirisame Marisa IV, Ministry of CBT

NOW YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY EDIT OPTIONS.TXT AND RESTART THE GAME TO EDIT
THE SOUND SLIDERS BECAUSE FUCK YOU!
